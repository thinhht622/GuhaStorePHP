                <p class="about__context h4">Mlouye’s founder and creative director Meb Rure hails from an industrial design background. In 2015, Meb decided to change gears and turn her energy towards Mlouye, a collection of exceptional handbags. Focusing on quality material, good design, craftsmanship and sustainability, Mlouye reflects the epitome of quality over quantity.</p>
                <p class="about__context h4">Meb was highly inspired by the Bauhaus Movement's artists and architects. From Mies van der Rohe's works to Kandinsky's paintings, to Aalto's furniture, she acquired a rationalist vision of design by gleaning how they served a utilitarian purpose in a cleverly simple way. Mlouye merges industrial design and fashion, creating functional handbags made of luxurious and honest materials to improve people's lives in small but important ways.</p>
                <p class="about__context h4">Innovation being the key factor alongside aesthetic, Mlouye has brought unexpected shapes with smart details, functionality and a new luxury feel with a contemporary price point.</p>
                <p class="about__context h4">Istanbul is where Mlouye was born, the company's headquarters is now split between the US, and Turkey.</p>
